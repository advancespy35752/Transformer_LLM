# Transformer (English to Hindi Language Translation)

## Dataset Used:
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from [Link](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in//samanantar/).

## transformer.py
This file contains the complete implementation of the transformer model.

## transformer_running_file.ipynb
In this notebook, we perform the following tasks:
1. Create a dataset for training by tokenizing the data.
2. Train the model using 2 million data points and 12 epochs.
3. Create a loss versus epoch graph to visualize the training progress.
4. Test the model by performing translations.

## Reference:
For reference, we adhere to the official paper "Attention is All You Need" for the transformer architecture. [Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
